This folder contains the following files
- `data-items.md`: describes the extracted data items for each included primary study. We created the table before extracting the first study to provide ourselves with a shared understanding and basis for discussion.
- `extraction.xlsx`: spreadsheet of 95 code comprehension primary studies with human participants, their metadata, and extracted study design characteristics. These entries formed the basis for all subsequent data analyses (see: `../data-analysis`).
